# ‚úàÔ∏è AeroLeon ‚Äì Flight Search & Booking UI

**AeroLeon** is a flight search and booking interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. It enables users to search flights between two cities, choose one-way or round-trip options, select travel dates and passenger count, and view dynamic flight listings fetched via an Express backend integrated with the Amadeus API.
